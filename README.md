# Transcode Notifier for Emby Server

Transcode Notifier is an Emby Server plugin that detects when a user's playback session is transcoding and sends a toast notification to the userâ€™s client. It helps raise awareness of transcoding events, which can impact playback quality and server performance.

## Features

- Sends customizable toast notifications to users when transcoding starts.
- Limits notifications to a configurable maximum number per video playback.
- Supports excluding specific users from receiving notifications.
